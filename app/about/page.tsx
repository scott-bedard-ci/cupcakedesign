          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The Cupcake Design System began as a simple idea: what if we created a component library that was as
            delightful to use as eating a cupcake? Scott had the vision for a design system that would be both
            functional and joyful, and together with v0, an AI assistant, brought that vision to life in just a few
            hours.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We started with the core components: Buttons as fluffy as cake, Alerts as attention-grabbing as colorful
            frosting, and Avatars as unique as cupcake toppings. Each component was crafted with care, ensuring they
            were not only beautiful but also accessible, responsive, and easy to implement.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            What makes Cupcake special isn't just its playful theme, but its attention to detail. Every component is
            designed to work seamlessly together, creating a cohesive user experience that's as satisfying as the
            perfect cupcake recipe. And just like baking, we believe in continuous improvementâ€”constantly refining our
            ingredients and methods to create the best possible result.
