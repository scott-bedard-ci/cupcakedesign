## 🚧 Current State

The site is running with Builder.io components **prepared but not yet active** to avoid the `isolated-vm` package conflicts that were causing crashes.

## 🎯 Next Steps to Activate Builder.io

### Option 1: Simple Activation (Recommended)
When you're ready to use Builder.io:

1. **Uncomment the registration import** in `app/layout.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   // Add this line back:
   import "@/lib/builder-registration"
   ```

2. **Test the registration** by checking your Builder.io dashboard for the custom components.

### Option 2: Alternative Setup
If you encounter issues with the `isolated-vm` package:

1. **Use Builder.io's online editor** to build pages
2. **Export the generated code** and integrate manually
3. **Use Builder.io's REST API** for content fetching without the SDK
