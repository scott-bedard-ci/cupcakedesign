# Component Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

Each component in the Cupcake Design System should include a dedicated documentation file (`ComponentName.docs.txt`) to explain the rationale behind design decisions and provide context for future developers.

## File Location

Documentation files should be placed in the same directory as the component they document:

\`\`\`
components/
  ├── Button.tsx
  ├── Button.docs.txt
  ├── Alert.tsx
  ├── Alert.docs.txt
\`\`\`

## Documentation Structure

Each component documentation file should include:

1. **Purpose**: Brief description of what the component is for
2. **Design Decisions**: Explanation of key design decisions and their rationales
3. **Accessibility Considerations**: Details about accessibility implementations
4. **Usage Guidelines**: When and how to use this component
5. **Evolution History**: Brief history of significant changes
6. **Related Components**: List of related components and when to use one vs. the other

## Benefits

- Provides context for why components were built a certain way
- Helps both human developers and AI assistants understand component design decisions
- Creates institutional knowledge that persists as team members change
- Simplifies onboarding for new developers
- Makes maintenance and refactoring decisions easier

## Template

A template for component documentation can be found at `docs/component-docs-template.txt`.
