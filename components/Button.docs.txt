# Button Component Documentation

## Purpose
The Button component provides a standardized way to create interactive buttons throughout the application. It handles different visual variants, sizes, and states while ensuring consistent styling and behavior.

## Design Decisions
- We used a composition pattern with variants (primary, secondary, tertiary) to allow for different visual styles while maintaining consistent behavior.
- The component accepts icons on either side to enhance visual communication.
- Touch feedback was added specifically for mobile experiences.
- Design tokens are used for all styling to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- We implemented minimum touch target sizes (44x44px) to ensure the button is usable on touch devices.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Focus states are clearly visible with a consistent ring style.
- Disabled states are properly conveyed visually and to assistive technology.
- All interactive elements maintain sufficient color contrast.
- The component ensures that icon-only buttons have accessible labels.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use primary buttons for main actions on a page.
- Use secondary buttons for alternative actions.
- Use tertiary buttons for destructive or cautionary actions.
- Avoid using too many primary buttons on a single page as it dilutes their impact.
- Always provide descriptive text for buttons to clearly communicate their action.

## Evolution History
- Initial implementation: Basic button with variant support
- Added icon support for enhanced visual communication
- Implemented touch feedback for mobile experiences
- Refactored to use design tokens instead of hardcoded values
- Added better accessibility support with focus states

## Related Components
- Link: Use when navigating to a different page rather than triggering an action
- IconButton: Use when only an icon is needed without text
- ButtonGroup: Use when grouping related buttons together
