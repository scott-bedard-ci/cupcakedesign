# Alert Component Fix - Empty Children Test

## Issue Description
The Alert component test was failing on the "renders without children" test. The test expected to find an empty div with the class "text-sm" when no children were provided to the Alert component, but it was not being rendered correctly.

## Root Cause
When no children were provided to the Alert component, but a title was present, the empty div with class "text-sm" was not being properly separated from the title element in the DOM structure. This caused the test to fail because the element that should be empty was actually containing content.

## Changes Made
1. Modified the component's JSX structure to ensure proper conditional rendering:
   - Used a more explicit ternary operator for the children rendering
   - Ensured the empty div is properly isolated when no children are provided
   - Maintained accessibility and visual appearance

2. Ensured the empty div is always rendered with the correct class when children are not provided

## Coding Standards Maintained
1. No design tokens needed to be changed as this was a structural issue
2. No inline styles were used in the fix
3. Mobile responsiveness was preserved with existing responsive classes
4. Accessibility was maintained with proper ARIA roles and attributes
5. Component structure and API remain consistent with documentation

## Testing
The fix ensures the component passes all tests while maintaining the expected visual appearance and functionality.
