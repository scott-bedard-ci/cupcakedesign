# Avatar Component Fix - Tooltip Hiding Issue

## Issue Description
The Avatar component had a test failure in the "shows tooltip on hover" test. After triggering mouseLeave, the tooltip was still visible in the document when it should have been hidden.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the tooltip hiding logic. The component was using a timeout to hide the tooltip, but this created an asynchronous behavior that didn't work well with the synchronous nature of the test.

## Changes Made
1. Modified the `handleHideTooltip` function to:
   - Clear any existing timeout first to prevent race conditions
   - Set the tooltip state to hidden immediately for mouse events
   - Remove the unnecessary timeout for mouseLeave events

2. Improved the timeout handling:
   - Changed the type of tooltipTimeoutRef to allow null values
   - Added proper cleanup of timeouts to prevent memory leaks
   - Added null checks before clearing timeouts

3. Enhanced touch event handling:
   - Maintained the timeout for touch events to give users time to read the tooltip
   - Properly typed the timeout to avoid TypeScript errors

## Coding Standards Maintained
1. Used design tokens for all styling
2. No inline styles were used
3. Maintained mobile responsiveness with appropriate touch targets
4. Preserved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
5. Kept the component structure and API consistent with documentation

## Testing
The fix ensures that the tooltip is immediately hidden on mouseLeave, which makes the test pass while maintaining the desired user experience.
