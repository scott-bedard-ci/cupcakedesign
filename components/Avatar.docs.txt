# Avatar Component Documentation

## Purpose
The Avatar component displays user profile images or initials in a consistent, accessible format. It handles fallbacks gracefully and supports grouping for displaying multiple users.

## Design Decisions
- We implemented automatic fallback to initials when no image is provided or when the image fails to load.
- Deterministic background colors are generated based on the user identifier to ensure consistency.
- Tooltips appear on hover/touch to show the full identifier.
- The component supports multiple sizes for different contexts.
- The AvatarGroup subcomponent handles showing multiple avatars efficiently with overlap and count indicators.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Images have appropriate alt text for screen readers.
- The component provides sufficient color contrast for text and backgrounds.
- Interactive behavior is keyboard accessible.
- Tooltips are properly implemented for screen readers.
- Touch targets are sized appropriately for mobile use.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use avatars consistently throughout the application to represent users.
- Use the small size for lists, comments, or secondary contexts.
- Use the medium or large size for profile pages or primary user contexts.
- Use AvatarGroup when displaying multiple users in a compact space.
- Ensure identifiers are meaningful (usually usernames or emails).
