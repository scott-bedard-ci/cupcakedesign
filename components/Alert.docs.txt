# Alert Component Documentation

## Purpose
The Alert component provides a consistent way to display important messages, notifications, or feedback to users. It supports different severity levels and can include actions.

## Design Decisions
- We implemented four variants (error, informational, success, warning) to cover all common notification scenarios.
- Each variant has distinctive colors and icons for immediate visual recognition.
- The component is designed to be dismissible when appropriate.
- We use a minimal set of props to make the API simple while covering all necessary use cases.
- Mobile optimization ensures alerts are readable and interactive on small screens.

## Accessibility Considerations
- The component uses the role="alert" attribute to ensure screen readers announce the alert appropriately.
- Color is never the only means of conveying information - icons and text work together.
- Dismiss buttons have appropriate aria labels.
- Focus management ensures keyboard users can easily interact with the alert.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use error alerts for critical issues requiring immediate attention.
- Use warning alerts for potential issues or cautionary information.
- Use success alerts for confirmation of completed actions.
- Use informational alerts for neutral updates or guidance.
- Keep alert messages clear, concise, and actionable.
- Avoid using too many alerts simultaneously as they can overwhelm users.

## Evolution History
